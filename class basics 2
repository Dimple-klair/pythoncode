class Student:
    leaves = 5 #this is for every student/written in template
    pass

#both harr and larr derived from same - class Student/
harr=Student()
larr=Student()

#below are the instances of Student class:-
harr.name='har'
harr.salary='10'

larr.name='lar'
larr.salary='20'

#below we can print/ACCESS LEAVES(variable of Student class) with the help of INSTANCES(harr or larr) OR (CLASS STUDENT)
print(Student.leaves)
#output- 5
print(harr.leaves)
#output- 5
print(larr.leaves)
##output- 5

#now if we want to change leaves we can only change it with the help of (CLASS STUDENT) only:- BECAUSE leaves is the property of class Student only
Student.leaves=10
print(Student.leaves)
#now output- 10



#but HARR/LARR can change his leaves(others property) with the help of an attribute - (.__dict__)
harr.leaves = 30
print(harr.__dict__)  #it returns a dictionary
#output- {'name': 'har', 'salary': '10', 'leaves': 30}
